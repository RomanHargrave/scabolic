##Tracking Copyright Information

There is no copyright notice in any file of this project as this is an
imprecise solution that involves duplication of data. Git --- being an
awesome distributed version control system --- maintains a very
precise history of who changed what and when. We thus rely entirely
on Git to track all information related to owners of code part.

In particular, the copyright is not centralized to one party but is kept by
each contributor. Basically each committer owns each one of his commit to this
repository. A commit message can indicate that the commit has been done on
behalf of a third party, and will then attribute the contribution to the
original author. The previous section on "Copyright Owners" is a short,
non-authoritative, summary of the persons holding copyright claim in this
project.

In order to simplify the licensing of the software, all code contributed to
this repository has to be released under the terms of the MIT licence. This
ensures maximal freedom for everybody in the use of the software.

BY COMMITTING TO THIS REPOSITORY, YOU ACCEPT TO RELEASE YOUR CODE UNDER
THE TERMS OF THE MIT LICENSE AS DESCRIBE IN THE LICENSE FILE.

SCABOLIC
========

This is the official repository for the Scabolic tool.  The aim of Scabolic is
to combine in a single tool/library several automated reasoning algorithms. In
particular this should (soon) support SAT/SMT solving as well as features from
computer algebra.

The project is using the Scala programming language and provide (well, it will
provide it in the near future) a nice Domain Specific Language (DSL) to be used
either as an interactive tool within the Scala REPL or as a Scala library.

This is work in progress.

Disclaimer
----------

This tool is not fast and will probably never be able to solve any real world
problem. The only concerns here are to provide correct and clean code. In
particular, clean and elegant code will (almost) always be chosen abovoe a more
efficient, but less nice approach. Note that the author advises to look for
alternatives (usually written in low-level C code) when in need for SAT/SMT
solvers that can actually solve real problems.

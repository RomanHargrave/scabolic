The aim of this project is to combine in a single tool/library several
automated reasoning algorithms. In particular this should (soon) support
SAT/SMT solving as well as computer algebra style features.

The project is using the Scala programming language and provide (well, it will
provide it in the near future) a nice Domain Specific Language (DSL) to be
used either as an interactive tool within the Scala REPL or as a library for
another Scala project.

This is work in progress.

DISCLAIMER

There is absolutely no objective to produce any kind of efficient code, the
only concerns here are to provide correct and clean code. In particular, clean
and elegant code will (almost) always be chosen before a more efficient, but
less nice approach. Note that it is advisable to look for alternatives (usually
written in low-level C code) when in need for SAT/SMT solvers that can
actually solve real problems.

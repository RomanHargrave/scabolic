#TODO

##General

* Tail recursive fold algorithms on trees. Stop passing set of bounded variables (should be built on
top of the fold method)

##Ideas to improve SAT solver
* No pre-allocated object pool in ClauseList
* Replace ClauseList by Arrays, better cache, slighly worst asymptotic complexity
* Heap without inversed index. Do we still need that ?
* Evaluate cost of clause deletion

##SMT solver

* Full interpreter for SMT-LIB 2

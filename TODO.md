#TODO

##Ideas to improve SAT solver
* No pre-allocated object pool in ClauseList
* Replace ClauseList by Arrays, better cache, slighly worst asymptotic complexity
* Heap without inversed index. Do we still need that ?
* Evaluate cost of clause deletion

##SMT solver

* Full interpreter for SMT-LIB 2
